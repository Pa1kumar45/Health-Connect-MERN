# Health-Connect - Interview Quick Prep Sheet

## üéØ 30-Second Project Pitch

> "Health-Connect is a full-stack telemedicine platform I built using MERN stack with real-time video calling and chat. It enables doctors and patients to connect remotely through WebRTC peer-to-peer video calls and Socket.IO-powered messaging. The application features secure JWT authentication, appointment scheduling with slot management, and persistent medical record storage. I solved challenging problems like WebRTC race conditions, NAT traversal, and memory leaks to achieve sub-100ms call setup and 90% direct connection success rate."

## üé§ Question 1: Real-Time Communication

### üîë Key Points

**Socket.IO:**

- Persistent WebSocket connections
- Online user tracking with Map data structure (O(1) lookup)
- Dual purpose: Chat messaging + WebRTC signaling
- Configuration: 60s ping timeout, 25s intervals, auto-reconnect

**WebRTC:**

- Peer-to-peer architecture (reduces server bandwidth)
- SDP offer/answer exchange via Socket.IO
- ICE candidates for NAT traversal (STUN servers)
- RTCPeerConnection with event handlers
- Direct media streams between clients

### üó£Ô∏è Answer Structure

1. "Hybrid architecture combining Socket.IO and WebRTC"
2. "Socket.IO handles signaling and chat with Map-based user tracking"
3. "WebRTC establishes P2P connections via SDP offer/answer"
4. "ICE candidates exchanged via Socket.IO for NAT traversal"
5. "Benefits: Low latency, reduced costs, horizontal scalability"

### üí¨ One-Liner

> "I implemented a hybrid architecture where Socket.IO manages real-time signaling and chat while WebRTC handles peer-to-peer video streams, reducing server bandwidth and achieving sub-100ms latency."

## üé§ Question 3: MongoDB Data Model

### üìö Collections Overview

**Doctors (Embedded Schedule)**

```
- Professional info: specialization, qualification, experience
- Schedule: [{day, slots: [{startTime, endTime, isAvailable}]}]
- Why embedded: Always accessed together, bounded growth
- Indexes: email (unique), specialization
```

**Patients (Medical Info)**

```
- Demographics: name, DOB, gender, blood group
- Medical: allergies, emergency contacts (embedded)
- Why embedded: Strong data locality, limited cardinality
- Indexes: email (unique), bloodGroup
```

**Appointments (Session History)**

```
- References: doctorId, patientId (normalized)
- Scheduling: date, startTime, endTime, status
- Medical: notes (consultation documentation)
- Feedback: rating, review
- Why normalized: Many-to-many, independent queries
- Indexes: doctorId+date+startTime, patientId+date+startTime
```

**Messages (Chat History)**

```
- Polymorphic refs: senderId, receiverId (doctor OR patient)
- Content: text, image (Cloudinary URL), type
- Metadata: read, createdAt
- Why normalized: Bidirectional querying
- Indexes: senderId+receiverId+createdAt, receiverId+read
```

### üîë Design Decisions

**Embed When:**

- Always accessed together (schedules with doctor)
- Bounded growth (max 7 days √ó 20 slots)
- Strong data locality needed
- 1:N with fixed N

**Reference When:**

- Many-to-many relationships
- Independent query patterns
- Unbounded growth
- Data reused across documents

### üó£Ô∏è Answer Structure

1. "Four collections: Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Messages"
2. "Embedded schedules for locality, referenced appointments for flexibility"
3. "Appointments serve dual purpose: scheduling + medical records"
4. "Compound indexes reduced queries from 200ms to <10ms"
5. "Scalability: Sharding by doctorId, archival for old data"

### üí¨ One-Liner

> "I designed a hybrid schema with embedded schedules for data locality and normalized appointments for flexible querying, using compound indexes to optimize from 200ms to under 10ms query time."

‚úÖ "MongoDB aggregation pipelines are powerful but require careful index planning"  
‚úÖ "Real-time systems need extensive error handling for network instability"

---

## üéØ Common Follow-Up Questions

### "Why not use a library like SimpleWebRTC?"

> "I wanted full control over the WebRTC implementation to optimize for healthcare use cases‚Äîlike prioritizing audio quality over video in low bandwidth, implementing custom error handling, and having flexibility to add features like call recording or screen sharing without library constraints."

### "How would you handle HIPAA compliance?"

> "I'd implement end-to-end encryption for messages, audit logging for all data access, session timeouts, data encryption at rest, BAA with cloud providers, and regular security audits. The current architecture already separates authentication from medical data, which is a good foundation."

### "What about horizontal scaling?"

> "Socket.IO can scale horizontally using Redis adapter for pub/sub across instances. MongoDB can shard by doctorId or patientId. For WebRTC, since it's P2P, scaling is mainly about the signaling server, which Socket.IO handles well."

### "Why MongoDB over PostgreSQL?"

> "Healthcare data has variable schemas‚Äîdifferent doctors track different things. MongoDB's flexible document model handles this well. Plus, nested documents like schedules and emergency contacts map naturally. For transactions, I'd add Mongoose transactions for critical operations."

### "How do you test WebRTC?"

> "I use manual testing with multiple browser instances, automated E2E tests with Puppeteer for UI flows, and would implement network emulation (throttling, packet loss) in a proper test environment. Unit tests cover the state management and buffer logic."

## üìù Code Snippets to Know

### ICE Candidate Buffering

```javascript
const pendingCandidatesRef = useRef<RTCIceCandidate[]>([]);

if (peerConnection.remoteDescription) {
    peerConnection.addIceCandidate(candidate);
} else {
    pendingCandidatesRef.current.push(candidate);
}
```

### Resource Cleanup

```javascript
localStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => track.stop());
peerConnection.close();
pendingCandidatesRef.current = [];
```

### Bidirectional Message Query

```javascript
Message.find({
  $or: [
    { senderId: userId1, receiverId: userId2 },
    { senderId: userId2, receiverId: userId1 },
  ],
}).sort({ createdAt: 1 });
```

### Compound Index Creation

```javascript
db.appointments.createIndex({
  doctorId: 1,
  date: 1,
  startTime: 1,
});
```
