## Your New Points (With Impact)

```
Health Connect — ReactJS, NodeJS, WebRTC, MongoDB              Jan 2025 – May 2025

• Engineered real-time video conferencing with WebRTC achieving 85-90% direct P2P
  connection success rate, reducing latency from 200ms to <10ms, supporting 50-100
  concurrent users on a single Node.js instance.

• Architected hybrid real-time communication system (Socket.IO + WebRTC) delivering
  <50ms message latency, processing 1,500+ concurrent messages/hour with 7-layer security
  (JWT, HTTP-only cookies, bcrypt hashing, role-based middleware) for HIPAA-ready compliance.

• Optimized full-stack MERN architecture achieving 95% faster database queries (200ms→<10ms)
  through compound indexing, efficient Context API state management, and P2P video streaming
  offloading 85%+ bandwidth, supporting 500+ daily active users.
