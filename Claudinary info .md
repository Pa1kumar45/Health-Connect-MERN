"We use Cloudinary as our image hosting service. When a user uploads an avatar or sends an image in chat, the frontend converts it to a Base64 string and sends it to our backend. Our controller then uses the Cloudinary SDK to upload the image to their CDN, which returns a secure HTTPS URL. We store only this URL in MongoDB—not the actual image file—which keeps our database lightweight. Cloudinary automatically optimizes images for web delivery and provides a global CDN for fast loading. This architecture separates media storage from our application server, improving scalability. We organize uploads into folders like health-connect/doctors, health-connect/patients, and health-connect/messages for better management."
