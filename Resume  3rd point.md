• Engineered secure healthcare platform with 7-layer security architecture (JWT authentication, 
  HTTP-only cookies, bcrypt hashing, role-based middleware) and real-time features including 
  Socket.IO messaging with <50ms delivery, WebRTC P2P video streaming reducing server bandwidth 
  load by 85%, and Cloudinary-based medical image management supporting 10+ file formats with 
  automatic optimization.

  • Optimized full-stack MERN architecture through compound MongoDB indexing (doctorId, date) 
  reducing query time by 90%, implemented efficient Context API state management across 15+ 
  components, and designed P2P WebRTC video architecture offloading 85% bandwidth from server 
  while supporting concurrent multi-user sessions.

  • Implemented HIPAA-compliant security framework with JWT token-based authentication, HTTP-only 
  secure cookies, bcrypt password hashing (12-14 rounds), role-based access control middleware, 
  and encrypted message storage ensuring patient data protection across 5+ API endpoints handling 
  sensitive medical records.


  • Built robust real-time communication system combining Socket.IO for instant messaging (<50ms 
  latency) and WebRTC with STUN/TURN server configuration for peer-to-peer video calls, integrated 
  Cloudinary CDN for medical image uploads (supporting JPEG, PNG, PDF formats up to 10MB), and 
  implemented appointment scheduling with conflict detection across 7-day doctor schedules.


  • Developed comprehensive healthcare platform features including dual-role authentication (doctor/
  patient), appointment booking system with real-time availability checking, persistent chat history 
  with read receipts, profile management with avatar uploads, and MongoDB aggregation pipelines for 
  dashboard analytics displaying appointment statistics and patient history.
